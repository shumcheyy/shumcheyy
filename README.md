 Application Security |  Golang Appreciator |  DevSecOps Explorer

Hi, I am Shubham. Blending application security with backend engineering, with a strong focus on building secure-by-design systems using Go. I enjoy digging into the internals of systems, understanding how things work under the hood, and turning that knowledge into practical tooling.

- Currently learning: Threat modeling,  memory/cgroup behavior, CI/CD hardening, Kubernetes Security

- Working with: Go, Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Advanced Security, Linux, AI

- Passionate about: breaking things to learn, securing what I build, and automating the boring stuff

- On a journey to deeply master DevSecOpsâ€”code to cloud

Always up for sharing ideas, weird bugs, or security war stories.
